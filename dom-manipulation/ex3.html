Co-founder Martin Eberhard was the original CEO of Tesla until he was asked to resign in August 2007 by the board of directors.<a href='#'>[4]</a><a href='#'>[25]</a> Eberhard then took the title of "President of Technology" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008 along with co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the CFO and subsequently the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company until 2008. <a href='#'>[4]</a><a href='#'>[25]</a></p>

    <p>Tesla signed a Roadster production contract on July 11, 2005, with Group Lotus to produce "gliders" (complete cars but without powertrain).<a href='#'>[29]</a> The Roadster used an AC motor descended directly from Nikola Tesla's original 1882 design.<a href='#'>[30]</a></p>

Tesla's third round included investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.<a href='#'>[39]</a> The fourth round in May 2007 added another US$45 million.</p>
    <p>In late 2007, Tesla brought on Michael Marks,<a href='#'>[40]</a> and later Ze'ev Drori, to replace Eberhard as CEO.<a href='#'>[41]</a> Drori temporarily returned the company to profitability, reducing the company's workforce by about 10%.<a href='#'>[42]</a> In October 2008, Musk became CEO and laid off an additional 25% of Tesla's workforce.<a href='#'>[41]</a> In December, a fifth round added another US$40 million, avoiding bankruptcy.<a href='#'>[43]</a><a href='#'>[44]</a></p>
